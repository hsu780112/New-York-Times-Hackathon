# New-York-Times-Hackathon

## Introduction
Welcome to our team's showcase for the New York Times Hackathon, a collaborative venture between BrainStation and New York Times. I'm thrilled to introduce our dynamic team, a mix of data scientists, UI/UX designers, and software engineers. 

### Our Team
- Aekta Patel (UX/UI Designer)
- Nick Kondis (Data Science)
- Owen Hsu (Data Science)
- Yulia Batrakova (Software Engineering)
- Earl Hermosa (Software Engineering)
- Justin Lee (Software Engineering)

## The Challenge
Our task was to address the following pivotal question:
How might we increase subscribers' awareness of and engagement with the wide range of the products The New York Times offers, from audio to games, cooking, wirecutter, and more.  

## Data Scientist's Resposibility 
As the data scientist on the team, my role was to evaluate the impact of a recent update to the New York Times app, designed to enhance user engagement within the Games, Cooking, and Audio sections. The update aimed to increase user interaction, time spent on these sections, and overall app retention. I conducted a comprehensive analysis of key engagement metrics—including session duration, click-through rates, and content consumption patterns—before and after the update to assess its effectiveness. The insights derived from this analysis helped determine the success of the update and informed recommendations for further optimization of the user experience.
